📂 Description
This project aims to build a concrete crack detection AI system using TensorFlow.

The initial model was inspired by the Concrete Crack Segmentation Dataset from DatasetNinja. I used their pre-trained model as a starting point, then fine-tuned it with my own dataset, which includes additional images from UAVs and different lighting conditions.

I also experimented with modifying the output layers and adding recurrent neural network (RNN) layers on top of the base model to improve performance in sequence-based tasks (e.g., damage detection over time or video frames).

🚀 Key Features
Based on the Concrete Crack Segmentation Dataset

Pre-trained on base dataset; fine-tuned on custom UAV and field-collected images

Architecture enhancements:

Output layers customized for my dataset

RNNs added to handle sequential data (optional for time-based tasks)

🔧 How to Use
Clone the repo.

Download the pre-trained model (instructions coming soon or [link here if you have it]).

Place your own dataset in the /data folder.

Run train.py to fine-tune the model with your data.

Run predict.py on new images to detect cracks.

📌 Notes
The pre-trained model is credited to the dataset creators.

I recommend using TensorFlow 2.x for compatibility.

🔥 Next Steps
If you’d like, I can help you:
✅ Find the pre-trained model file (if available)
✅ Draft the train.py script for transfer learning
✅ Write a requirements.txt file
✅ Help you structure your code better (folders, modules)

🛠️ For the Technical Implementation:
Here’s a step-by-step approach to doing this in your code:

1️⃣ Download the pre-trained model from the dataset site (if provided).
2️⃣ Load it in TensorFlow using tf.keras.models.load_model() or similar.
3️⃣ Freeze some of the base layers (so they don’t get retrained) and add your own layers on top.
4️⃣ Add your custom outputs or RNNs on top if needed.
5️⃣ Compile the model and fine-tune it with your dataset.

🚀 Final Tip:
Make sure you credit the dataset’s authors if they have any licensing or attribution requirements.

If you want, I can help you draft the training script or adjust the README — just let me know! 🚁💪
